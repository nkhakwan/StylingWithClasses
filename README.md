# Today it was the day for styling with classes
### First cupcake-shop.html practices styling with classes
### Second Animal shelter html practiced div's and span's
### Third Resume.html practices with Box styles and ol and ul withing boxes and cascading
# None of the file is yet index.html. So i am not loading the gh-pages. As a second thought i might make Resume to be index.html. In that case i would update README.md
